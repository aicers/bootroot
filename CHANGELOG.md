## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `bootroot rotate ca-key` for intermediate-only CA key rotation
  and `bootroot rotate ca-key --full` for root + intermediate rotation.
  Both modes use an 8-phase idempotent workflow with crash-safe resume
  via `rotation-state.json`.
- Added `bootroot rotate openbao-recovery` for manual OpenBao recovery
  credential rotation (unseal keys and/or root token), including
  operator-confirmed execution and post-rotation continuity coverage.
- Added core Bootroot CLI lifecycle foundations, including infra readiness,
  init/status, service onboarding, verify/rotate flows, and related guardrails.
- Added remote-bootstrap operations via `bootroot-remote` with pull/ack/sync,
  summary JSON handling, retry controls, and schedule templates.
- Added extended E2E workflow separation for heavier scenarios.
- Added Python quality gates with Ruff (format/lint) in CI and docs workflows.

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicate i18n entry templates:
  `infra_entry_*`/`monitoring_entry_*` merged into
  `readiness_entry_*`, and `status_infra_entry_*`/
  `monitoring_status_entry_*` merged into `status_entry_*`.
  No user-visible output changes.

- Changed DB DSN runtime handling to normalize local hosts for compose runtime
  compatibility.
- Changed service onboarding output to clarify Bootroot-managed vs
  operator-managed boundaries and trust-related behavior.
- Changed managed trust bootstrap so `bootroot service add` and
  `bootroot-remote bootstrap` stage the OpenBao-backed CA bundle and
  fingerprints before the first `bootroot-agent` run, instead of relying on
  skipped CA verification during initial issuance.
- Expanded Docker E2E coverage (baseline, rotation recovery, main lifecycle,
  remote lifecycle) and aligned local preflight paths with CI expectations.

### Fixed

- Fixed `parse_db_dsn` silently ignoring `sslmode` when it is
  not the first query parameter in the DSN string.
- Log a warning when an EAB JSON file contains empty `kid` or
  `hmac` fields instead of returning `Ok(None)` silently.
- Preserve original error chains in filesystem helpers
  (`fs_util`) by using `with_context` instead of formatting the
  error into a new string.
- Fix `bootroot rotate stepca-password` failing with TTY allocation error
  when running in non-interactive environments by adding `-f` flag to `step
  crypto change-pass` command
- Bind PostgreSQL to localhost in `docker-compose.yml` so that
  `bootroot rotate db` can connect from the host without exposing the DB
  to external interfaces. Set `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` if the default port 5432
  conflicts with a local PostgreSQL instance.
- Fixed `bootroot rotate db` failing with SQL syntax error. PostgreSQL's
  `ALTER ROLE ... WITH PASSWORD` and `CREATE ROLE ... WITH PASSWORD` statements
  do not support parameterized queries (`$1`). The password is now properly
  escaped as a string literal.
- Fixed `bootroot rotate db` panic with "Cannot start a runtime from within a
  runtime" error by running the synchronous postgres client on a blocking
  thread via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.
- Fixed hosts-mode lifecycle instability and related CI reproducibility issues.
- Fixed and strengthened trust sync and trust verification behavior with
  stronger E2E assertions.
