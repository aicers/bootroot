# Changelog

This file documents recent notable changes to this project. The format of this
file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added core Bootroot CLI lifecycle foundations, including infra readiness,
  init/status, service onboarding, verify/rotate flows, and related guardrails.
- Added remote-bootstrap operations via `bootroot-remote` with pull/ack/sync,
  summary JSON handling, retry controls, and schedule templates.
- Added extended E2E workflow separation for heavier scenarios.
- Added Python quality gates with Ruff (format/lint) in CI and docs workflows.

### Changed

- Changed DB DSN runtime handling to normalize local hosts for compose runtime
  compatibility.
- Changed service onboarding output to clarify Bootroot-managed vs
  operator-managed boundaries and trust-related behavior.
- Expanded Docker E2E coverage (baseline, rotation recovery, main lifecycle,
  remote lifecycle) and aligned local preflight paths with CI expectations.

### Fixed

- Fix `bootroot rotate stepca-password` failing with TTY allocation error
  when running in non-interactive environments by adding `-f` flag to `step
  crypto change-pass` command
- Bind PostgreSQL to localhost in `docker-compose.yml` so that
  `bootroot rotate db` can connect from the host without exposing the DB
  to external interfaces. Set `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` if the default port 5432
  conflicts with a local PostgreSQL instance.
- Fixed `bootroot rotate db` failing with SQL syntax error. PostgreSQL's
  `ALTER ROLE ... WITH PASSWORD` and `CREATE ROLE ... WITH PASSWORD` statements
  do not support parameterized queries (`$1`). The password is now properly
  escaped as a string literal.
- Fixed `bootroot rotate db` panic with "Cannot start a runtime from within a
  runtime" error by running the synchronous postgres client on a blocking
  thread via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.
- Fixed hosts-all lifecycle instability and related CI reproducibility issues.
- Fixed and strengthened trust sync and trust verification behavior with
  stronger E2E assertions.
